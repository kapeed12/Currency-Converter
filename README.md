This is a simple Currency Converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to easily convert between different currencies based on the latest exchange rates.
--Technologies Used

JavaScript: To handle the functionality, including fetching exchange rate data and performing conversions.
API (Optional): I am using open exchange rate api for conversion to currency.
